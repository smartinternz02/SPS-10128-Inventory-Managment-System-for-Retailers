                    <p class="card-text">Inventory management software is a fast-growing multi-billion dollar
                        industry. The inventory management software market is expected to reach $3.2 billion
                        by 2025.. From retailers operating large warehouses to small businesses with limited
                        stock, inventory management software helps organizations of all sizes manage their
                        supply effectively and efficiently.This makes online inventory management software a
                        cost-effective option for small businesses.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Online inventory management software is accessed through the internet, rather than
                        through a program installed on your physical computers and servers. This greatly
                        reduces your company’s hardware requirements. What’s more, the subscription-based
                        pricing plans these systems typically offer tend to be less expensive than the
                        traditional, desktop-based systems. This makes online inventory management software a
                        cost-effective option for small businesses.
